I received a CSV data from VS Group, a U.S. Company with ambitions to expand its burgeoning E-Commerce business within the U.S.A. They asked me to modernise their outdated Database structure as they are seeking to transition to a more sustainable SQL database solution to enhance operational efficiency and scalability

In Addition to this technical upgrade, VS Group also wishes to conduct a comprehensive analysis. This endeavour aims to gather valuable insights that will inform their strategic approach and go-to-market strategy 

Using SQL, I designed a relational database, created structured tables, and populated them with data from the original CSV file.
